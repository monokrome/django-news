# django news
#### Brandon R. Stoner <monokrome@monokro.me>

## What is this?

A django application for posting news. This is a fairly decent *news or blogging* application, and easily provides features like comments, markup, and RSS and ATOM feeds at no cost. However it makes no assumptions regarding your design, and therefore doesn't include any WYSIWYG/WYSIWYM editors or anything like that. You can easily add your own by simply applying it to <textarea> elements with a 'text-edit' class. This application also ties into the django user authentication system to allow multiple users to post, edit, and delete news articles on the web site.
